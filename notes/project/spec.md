## Project
Decide on title  
A programming language

## **Introduction**

The problem

Outline of my proposed solution

Inspiration for my solution

Potential applications of my solution

How does this differ from other languages?




Why a new language?
1. I've always wanted to build a full statically-typed language compiler. Now
   is my chance.


In recent years JavaScript has become very popular for use in front-end
development. It's no secret that JavaScript is flawed in many ways. It's not a
nice language, and t 

I've spent a lot of time doing front-end work in JavaScript. The community that
surrounds JavaScript is incredibly creative, and have come up with many new
ways of doing software development. One reason this may be is because there was
no correct way of writing JS. It's a bad language. It has many mistakes, but
because of its integration in the browser people have had to write JS out of
necessity. As a result many people have come up with various approaches to JS
code.

Why make a new language?  
I don't want to build a new language in order to show off new syntax, though
I am quite opinionated about syntax. I want to develop a language that looks
and feels similar to JavaScript, but instead of being dynamically typed it
will be statically typed.

Other language examples.
Very brief

## **Background / Preamble**
The first prototype I made once
Other programming I've done

## **Objectives**
In order from most important to least, 6-7 objectives to complete

- Build a parser for my typed JavaScript
- Build a type solver that uses Hindley Milner type inference
- Build an interpreter that interprets byte code
- Build a cross platform user interface that executes your code as you write
  it
- Create a small standard library, which supports data processing and
  graphical user interfaces.

## **Methodology**

I will be building the project in C++, since it's incredibly fast, yet not too
low level (as in C) where I have to implement every detail.

**The Parser**  
For parsing I will be writing my own recursive-descent parser.

**The Type Solver**  
For type inference I will implement the Hindley-Milner "Algorithm W". I've
only ever read about Hindley-Milner, so it'll be quite challenging to fully
implement it and have it be robust as well.

**The Interpreter**  
For the interpreter I will implement a byte code generator which takes my type
checked AST and spits out simple byte code that I can then interpret. I plan
to base my virtual machine off the PythonC byte code virtual machine.

**The Cross-platform GUI**  
In order to build a cross-platform GUI, I will learn to use Qt, which is a GUI
library written in C++ that is supported on many platforms.

**The Standard Library**  


## **Project Management**

### Project Timeline
Gantt chart: should be object specific
Objectives listed and when you'll do them

### Risks.
Risks and how I manage them
- Illness, ...
- Loss of work, ...
- Stealing, ...

### Ethical Considerations
Level 1: no ethical considerations to be made
