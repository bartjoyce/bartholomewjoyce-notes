#### **Lecture 1** â€“ January 8th, 2018

You will learn about stereo vision: how to estimate depth.

### Objectives

- To understand the typical sensing modalities used in modern mobile robots: different types of sensors, how they work, how the data is processed, etc...
- To become familiar with different approaches of localisation and navigation in mobile robotics: where you are, and how to get to your destination.
- To learn how to design, implement and evaluate robotics algorithms in real-world application scenarios: in the labs you'll work with Lego NXT robots.

### Fundamental Questions

- **Where am I?** $\Rightarrow$ Sensing & Perception.
- **Where am I going?** $\Rightarrow$ Localisation & Mapping.
- **How should I get there?** $\Rightarrow$ Planning & Control.

### Assessment

- Three-hour exam (80%), answer 4/7 questions, same format as past papers.
- Coursework (20%), detailed below.

### Coursework

A: Paired practical activity over 5 weeks [20%]  
B: Individual written assignment (approx. 2000 words) [80%]

You will be programming a Lego NXT robot using the LeJOS firmware (writing your solutions in Java).

Deadline: easter holiday.

### Programming Prerequisites

- Basic algebra: vectors, matrices, ...
- Some extra calculus: vector calculus, differential equations, ...
- Probability theory: probability distributions, Bayes rule, ...
- Programming: Java.

### Suggested Reading

- Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, Dieter Fox, *Probabilistic Robotics*, MIT Press

### **What is a Robot?**

A robot is:

1. An artificial device that can *sense* its environment and *act purposefully* in it.
2. An *embodied* artificial intelligence.
3. A machine that can autonomously carry out useful work.

Building on that we have mobile robots:

- A ***mobile*** robot is a robot capable of moving around in its environment and perform certain tasks.
- The ability to move extends the *workspace* of a mobile robot substantially, an attractive feature for many applications.
- However, extended workspace also means that the mobile robot should be able to do the following: have some knowledge about its environment, recognize objects in the environment, generate a real-time response, and do all of these simultaneously.
